# Parallel EVM

Welcome to Parallel EVM, a high-performance Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) implementation written in Go. This project leverages parallel processing techniques to enhance the efficiency and speed of EVM command execution, making it ideal for scalable and resource-intensive applications.

## Features

- **Parallel Execution**: Executes EVM commands across a specified range of blocks using a multi-threaded approach for improved speed.
- **Dynamic Load Balancing**: Allocates tasks dynamically and balances load across multiple threads to optimize performance.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Provides real-time updates on execution progress, allowing for better tracking and debugging.
- **High Efficiency**: Designed to handle high transaction volumes with minimal latency.

## Getting Started

To get started with Parallel EVM, you'll need to have Go (version 1.18 or later) installed. Follow the steps below to set up your environment and run the project:

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Go**: Make sure you have Go installed. You can download it from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).

2. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/parallel-evm.git
    cd parallel-evm
    ```

3. **Build the Project**:
    ```bash
    go build -o parallelevm
    ```

### Usage

To run Parallel EVM, use the following command:

```bash
./parallelevm [options]
```

Replace `[options]` with the appropriate flags for your use case. For a full list of options and their descriptions, run:

```bash
./parallelevm --help
```

### Configuration

You can configure Parallel EVM using a configuration file. The default configuration file is `config.json`. Modify this file to set parameters such as block range, thread count, and other options.

### Example Configuration

```json
{
    "blockRangeStart": 1000000,
    "blockRangeEnd": 1000100,
    "threadCount": 8,
    "monitoring": true
}
```
